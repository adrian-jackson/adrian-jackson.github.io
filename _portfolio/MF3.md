title: "Multiplexed Fused Filament Fabricator (MF3)"
excerpt: "A multi-year project involving the creation of a multiplexed FFF 3D printer. I was responsible, in early stages, for assisting in electrical construction and design using Arduinos, RAMPS heating element controllers, a LabVIEW chassis, etc. After the hardware and firmware construction was completed, we began to use it as a testbed for defect correction control schemes; specifically, prevention of over- and under- printing via in-situ parameter changes. My precise role involved creating a machine vision system (both hardware and software) with OpenCV that could precisely and accurately quantify the over- and under- printing present in a sample in real time, as well as testing of our controller and operation/maintainence of the machine. <br/><img src='/images/MF3_broad.JPG'>"
