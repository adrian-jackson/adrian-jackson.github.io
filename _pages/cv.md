Education
======
* **BS in Electrical Engineering**, Rutgers University, New Brunswick  
  *September 2022 - December 2025 (Anticipated)*  
  GPA: 3.78

Research Experience
======
* **Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
  *October 2022 - Present*  
  Advanced Manufacturing Sciences Lab, Rutgers University  
  -Created a real-time error quantifier for voids and overprinting defects found in Fused Filament Deposition (FFF) processes  
  -Assisted in the creation of a real-time control system which corrected over- and under-printing defects in FFF with over 95% accuracy. ***Was awarded the Goldwater Scholarship for this work.***  
  -Created a comprehensive dataset of questions testing FDM concepts and technical knowledge in order to evaluate different LLM chatbots on their knowledge of additive manufacturing.  
  -Assisted in the design and construction of the electrical systems and LabVIEW firmware of a multiplexed FFF 3D printer (capable of producing parts at up to 10x the speed of a traditional printer with no resolution loss) and Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing Welder (a testbed for creating defect correction control schemes for metal additive processes)  
  -Developed a symbolic regression algorithm to express physical properties of 3D printed parts in terms of its inputs with an analytical expression with under 5% nominal error.

* **Academic Year Research Intern**  
  *August 2024 – May 2025*  
  New Jersey Space Grant Consortium  
  -Created a control system to detect and prevent 3D printing stringing defects in real-time leveraging Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning

* **Summer Research Intern**  
  *May 2024 – August 2024*  
  New Jersey Space Grant Consortium  
  -Collaborated with NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate to develop in-situ hot rolling compression of FFF 3D printed parts to enhance mechanical strength and reduce defects of parts.  
  -Developed a machine learning model to predict changes in geometry due to the hot rolling process.

* **Research Assistant**  
  *July 2021 - August 2021*  
  Kean University  
  -Assisted Dr. David Joiner at Kean University in creating a convolutional neural network to detect and identify pollen presence and types in conjunction with the Pollen Underground initiative.
